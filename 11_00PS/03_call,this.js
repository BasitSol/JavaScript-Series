// Now we will be talking about the CALL
// How call keyword actually works ?


// The question is 
/*
function(){
callME()           if tell me where 'this' keyword refer ? is it outer or inner context and both functions have their execution context 
                   so for that thing 'this' actually refer to global execution context.
                   NOTE This is real life scenario: we know that in Global EC when we have window object access then 'this' actually refer the window object 
                   but when in node environment there is no window environment so 'this' refer to empty object.
