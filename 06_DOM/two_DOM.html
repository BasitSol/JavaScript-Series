<!-- NOW WE ARE GOING TO LEARN ABOUT THE DOM SELECTORS -->
how we can acces the class or the id of the html?

1)document.getElementById('title').id 
this will allow us to make acces the object having id </title>

2)document.getElementById('title').className
we can also acces the class attribute(if any)through the id . but make sure yiu write the className instead of
just class otherwise it wont work. 

3)document.getElementById('title').getAttribute('class')
you can also get or access the class or id attribute using this and passing the class just.

4)document.getElementById('title').setAttribute('class', 'test') or ('class', 'test heading')
here i can set the name of the class attribute to test so it depend on me what name i want to give and 
i can give as much names as i want

5)const title = document.getElementById(title)
here i stored the value in the title variable

6)title.style.backgroudColor = "black"
i can also change the color, padding , border , border radius of this object through .style

7)title.textContent , .innerHTML, .innerText
they all use to bring or access the content of the html object 
but are they are same ? nooo
the difference in these three are 

Difference betwen the textContent and a innerText
innerText shows you the text that is actually visible 
textContent gives you that text as well that you have been hide using the css property (Will give you the Hidden text)

.innerHTML will give you the complete html value suppose that
<h1>This is the best <span>Javascript series ever</span></h1>

now innerHTML will give you complete HTML Content along with the span tag and its content just like complete line
indirectly innerHTML supports the html tags as well and  inerText, textContent dont

document.querySelector('h1')
this will bring you the first h1 tag content

document.querySelector('#title')   // This is to Select the id and bring it  you can also select class attribute like .title 

document.querySelector('input[type="password"]')  you can also select the input field having the type password
you can use this query selector to acces any of the content based on the css selectors 

what if you want to change the first li one of the ul into green as there are 3 li's
const ul = document.querySelector('ul')

ul.querySelector('li')
 
save it another variable
const turnGreen = ul.querySelector('li')

now turnGreen.style.backgroudColor='green' now the first li converted into green backgroudColor
now thats how you can do any kind of changings using the css properties


// **************** querySelectoAll ***********************
 
when you use the querySelectorAll for extracting all the list it will give you result in a node list

now what's the differnce in node list and array or normal list 

actually nodelist and html collection are not actually pure array 

In node list you will get the foreach but you wont get the feature "map" which is by-default available in arrays

now lets suppose 
const mynodeli = document.querySelectorAll('li') => node:['li','li','li']
mynodelist.style.color = 'green'   => error you cant change use it like a pure array and apply properties
yes it's an array but its not a pure array

Now how we can do this thing (changing the color or applying the properties)?
mynodeli[0].style.color = 'red' => now you will be able to change the color of the first li

Key point :
if you want to apply the map so first you need to convert it into array or list and then use the map fucntionaity

key point:
when you use select the by class name what would happen then

const classList = document.getElementByClass('li')
classList.forEach((li)=>{}) // Error

now when you select the element using the class it give you the HTML collection which is again different fromthe nodelist and simple list(array)
so you cant apply the map and forEach fucntionalities here 
 
now what's the solution for this ?
list when you convert node list into list similarly you need to convert the html Collection into list first 

methods to convert :
Array.from(classList)  => now it will give you an array, now you can apply all those properties 
// Don't Forget to Always keep the first letter capital like => Array.from()
